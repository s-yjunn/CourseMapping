SPECIFICATIONS FOR "KNITTY GRITTY"

**Data**
Four categories of data:
1. User credentials and information
    - Stored as an object in "Private/data/users.json"
    - Each user has a key => value entry in the object. The key is the user's username, and the value is an object   
      that currently only contains a "password" attribute, but will later contain other fields for information like 
      which patterns the user wants to display privately vs. publicly, biographical information they provide for their profile, and so on.
2. Forum posts and responses
    - Stored as an array in "Public/data/forum.json"
    - Each post is an object with "author", "title", "content", "score" (intialized at 0, raised/lowered by
      up/down voting), "posted" (UTC timestamp of post creation), "active" (UTC timestamp of last response),
      and "responses" attributes.
    - "responses" => an array of response objects, each of which has "author", "content", "score", and "posted"
      attributes.
3. Contest submissions, accepted entries, winners
    - These data currently take the form of instructions to complete a knitting project, an image of the finished
      product, and the submitting user's username.
    - Image files are stored in "Public/contest/"
    - All other information is stored as an object in "Public/data/contest.json"
    -  Each contest entry has an object with fields "author", "image" (name of image file), 
      "text" (extracted from user submission), and "score" (starts at 0, raised by voting).
    - These objects live in one of three arrays within the main contest object: "submissions",
        "contestants", and "winners".
    - When a user submits an image and txt file to the contest, their image is added to the
        "contest" folder, and a new object of the type described above is initialized and added
        to the "submissions" array in the main contest object.
    - Then, if approved by the site administrator (still to be implemented), the submission is moved
        into the "contestants" array. Otherwise, it is deleted.
    - Finally, after voting on the "contestants" is complete (decided by admin -- still to be implemented),
        the winners are moved into the "winners" array, while the other contestant entries are deleted. 
4. Patterns created on the site's grid canvas (still to be implemented)
    - These will be saved as images in a location tbd -- probably a private folder for each user.

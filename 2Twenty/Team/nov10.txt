UPDATE: Nov. 10, 2020

What we have accomplished:
    - Search function works: items displayed based on tags, title, description and seller, sorts by relevance regarding keyword searched for. Next possible steps: sort by price.
        This code was uploaded to bitbucket on Nov. 10
    - Created an Excel Sheet with sample items
    - Data file

Next steps:
    - Sign up and login functions
    - Personal user page: where a user could perhaps sell items, view past orders, etc.
    - "Add to cart" function
    - Administrative site: Administrator will be able to delete users/items

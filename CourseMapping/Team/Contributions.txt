Allison:
    Data: 
    1. courses.json
    2. majors.json
    3. Structure of pathway JSON

    Saving:
    1. Structure of file system for users (user and pathway id's)
    2. save.js
    4. openSaved.js, 
    5. script.js, all except the part that asks the user whether they want to save
    6. logout.js, which saves the user’s open tabs if they click yes. Again, querying the user was Hyana’s

    General Functionality:
    1. Additions to pathway.js,
        These additions include interactions with session storage and currentPathway to store user's edits to the pathway.
        I also added a method to remove a courseBlock from the HTML and storage.
    2. pathwayFront.js with Yujun  
        I added the part that deals with adding prereqs
    
    Pop-ups:
    1. Added message bar to index.html.php
    2. messageBar.css
    3. messageBar.js, a function to display message with messageBar
    4. removePopUp.html, a pop-up that asks the user if they want to remove course blocks that used to be the prereqs for 
        a course that they changed the prereqs for.
    5. popUp.css, styling for the pop-up described above.
   
    Site
    1. Created the buttons that allow the user to open saved pathways
    2. Added the ability to change the pathway title: 
         Added the pathwayTitle and titleChanger to tab.html
         pathwayMeta.php

Hyana:
    Data: 
    1. Users.json

    Design:
    1. Website design (tab, admin page) in general based on our mid-term 
    2. ask if user will save the tab or not before logout/remove the tab using jquery-ui
    3. View.css, add.css, tab.css(not related to tab.html)

    Admin/server side:
    1. addCourse.php: can add a course to courses.json and majors.json
    2. rmCourse.php: Can remove course(s) from courses.json
    3. userinfo.php: indicates which user is logged in(guest, admin, user)
    4. viewCourses.js/viewMajors.js: admin can look at the data from courses.json and majors.json easily.

    Register/login:
    1. Register.php/login.php: Implemented register & login feature
    2. logouttabs.php/logintabs.php: Different tabs will be shown depends on the login status(admin, user, guest)
    3. loginStyle.css: Implemented pop-up modal to register and login features

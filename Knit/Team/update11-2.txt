This week we: wrote our project proposal, figured out a preliminary folder organization, got our first files on git, and created a prototype of our project's front page, including dynamic tabbing, stubs of each tab, and functional css.

Problems we encountered were primarily with git -- pushing and handling merging on pull.

This week we: created a functional forum, login page, and registration page, began the pattern maker page, and almost finished the code for the slideshow on the "winners" and "vote" pages.
